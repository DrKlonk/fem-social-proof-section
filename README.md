# Frontend Mentor challenge #3

## Outline

The design is pretty basic, but has got some tricky features. I've focused on getting the HTML and BEM-naming straight. I started out using CSS Grid for fun, but ended up refactoring it to Flexbox, because resizing and positioning the staggered items was just easier like that.

## What I've learned

This was probably the last time I've done desktop-first.

## Questions I still have

I am wondering if the way I put the background images in there is the way to go.
